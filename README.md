# PrototypingAnimation
Animating 3 core mobile motion design principles

# Summary 
This is a prototype of a fitness app home screen featuring animated interactive elements for my Innovative Technologies for Design class.

# About 
Using Figma, I designed several animated elements to enhance user engagement and feedback viewing options. I chose Figma for this project because I believe it best supports my growth as a UX designer, and I’m glad I did—I gained valuable new skills that I can apply to other interfaces (and I know I for sure will be applying them!).  

I created three different animations on this home screen. The first animation allows users to extend the view on a certain health category. In this example, a user can view more about their sleep analysis with the widget expanding. The second animation occurs when the user wants to switch over from viewing information about thier physical health and view information about their mental health by the blue bar sliding from under "physical" to "mental". Finally, the third animation is on the "Mental" half of the homescreen with the flame going from unfilled to filled. This interaction gives a playful vibe and I feel like adds a hint of gamification to the screen, making it more engaging for users.

# Reflection
I really enjoyed this project! I was initially a little scared as I have almost no experience with animation and the After Effects demo alsmot rocked my world. When working on this, I found the process of incorporating the small animations into a digital experience to enhance interactivity and visual appeal exciting.  

Working on this project, I learned several new interaction design techniques in Figma that I will continue to apply in future designs. Gaining these advanced skills will strengthen my portfolio as I pursue a career in UX design. I’m  glad to have expanded my knowledge beyond Figma’s basic interaction tools and this experience has inspired me to further develop my animation skills!
